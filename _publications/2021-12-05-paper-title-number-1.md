excerpt: 'Current context-aware computing still lacks good representation models, particularly in modeling for proactive decision making in the era of Ubiquitous Computing and the Internet of Things (IoT), To mitigate this issue, we proposed a state-based model of context in our prior research. Based on the model, we introduced Context State Machines (CSM) for simulating state changes of context attribute, situation, and context, which imply contextual behaviors that are often overlooked while very important to context reasoning and system decisions. This research applies CSMs to a real-world context-aware problem from the literature: a smart elevator control system ...'
