I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Charleston Southern University.  
I received a Ph.D. in Computer Science in August 2019 from the Department of Computer Science at the University of Alabama (UA) in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. My thesis advisor was Dr. Randy Smith. In 2009, Dr. Yue graduated with a BE in Software Engineering Institute from East China Normal University in Shanghai, China. My general research interest lies in the areas of software engineering, automation, and artificial intelligence. His research includes topics from software engineering for context-aware software, IoT, smart cities, contextual data modeling, automation of context reasoning, software privacy and security, and computer vision. He serves as a reviewer for conferences and journals, including IEEE Internet of Things Journal, IEEE Access, Computer Communication, Pervasive and mobile computing, etc.

### Research Interests
- Internet of Things
- Automated Context Reasoning, Modeling
- Intelligent Software Engineering
- Automated ontology generation for software evolution (LLMs + reasoning)
- Graph learning for database query optimization (GCN, arm selection)
- SE standards & ethics ontology (SECEPP) and evaluation datasets
- AI education at scale: labs and assignments for AI, Algorithms, and Distributed Systems

### Highlights
- **NSF CRII**: Automated Ontology Generation for Software Evolution  
- **OntoTune**: Metadata + plan graph → GCN → query plan selection  
- **SECEPP Ontology**: Gold-Short/Medium/Long evaluation sets  
- **Teaching**: *Fundamentals of AI*, *Advanced Computer Architecture*, *Distributed Systems*, *Algorithms*

### News
- 2025 — CRII project kickoff and student recruitment (see **Openings**)  
- 2025 — Ongoing LLM-ontology pipeline papers  
- 2025 — New Graudate Level Course Developed - Artificial Intelligence
- 2024 — New Undergraduate Level Course - Foundamentals of Artificial Intelligence
